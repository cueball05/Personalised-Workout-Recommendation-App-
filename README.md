# Personalised-Workout-Recommendation-App-
A workout recommendation mobile app using KivyMD library on Python coding environment. This project was started as a hobby with a friend.   

The homepage consists of a navigation drawer allowing the user to enter and update their personal data that the logic part (still work in progress) will use to personalise their workout routines. This data is stored as a .json file which can be accessed and overwritten should the user update their data.

The second screen 'workscreen' lists down a period of up to 6 weeks of workouts that the user will have access to. However, this may be subject to change to possibly include more weeks or adopting a better format of presenting this information to the user. 

Clicking on each week will bring the user to the 'workout' screen which will dynamically display a series of workouts (still work in progress) based on the users given personal data. The user will have the option to rate the workout in terms of the number of reps, total weight and intensity of the workout. This data will be used to further personalise the users workout routine.
